Lab-1 (Gumball Machine)
We had 2 options for Gumaball machines : One Quarter or Two Quarter Accepting Gumball. 
For the same we had created different classes and implemeted the required logic. 
However, the problem is to accomodate new features or updates for the classes, for which we need to certain chnages in both the classes.

Lab-10 (Feature IDE)
FeatureIDE aspect, the configuration for the GumBallMachine execution us defined in the file and as the execution mentioned in the 
the file the process flow/execution takes place. 
# Easily managable:
Making changes in the file are easy and can accomodate new requirements without much chnages needed.
